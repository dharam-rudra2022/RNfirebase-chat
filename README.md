# Chat application using React Native, Expo, and Firebase as the backend service. 

 The application will contain a simple login system using an email address for each specific user. The user will be allowed to upload a profile picture. The chat application will be more of a global chat room but works in real-time.
 
 ## Instal Dependencies
 
 To get started, you must have Expo CLI installed on your local machine. Run the following commands from your terminal in order to install the CLI and generate a new project using it.
 
 ```http
# To install expo-cli
npm install -g expo-cli

# To generate new project
expo init RNfirebase-chat

# Choose blank template when asked

# traverse inside the project directory
cd RNfirebase-chat
```


Once the project is generated, you can run it in an iOS simulator or an Android emulator to verify that everything works. Android developers should make sure that an Android Virtual Device is running before executing the command below.

```http
# for iOS simalulor
yarn ios

# for Android device/emulator
yarn android
```
